\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelims}

A brief discussion of state-of-the-art popular cryptographic techniques in literature for secure online data sharing is presented in Appendix \ref{app_sec:relwork}. We also provide a brief overview of bilinear non-degenerate mappings on elliptic curve sub-groups, popularly known in literature as pairings \cite{silverman1994advanced} in Appendix \ref{app_sec:prelims}. Next, we focus on the complexity assumptions used to prove the security of the encryption schemes proposed in this paper. A well-known complexity assumption in literature is the BDHE (Bilinear Diffie Hellman Exponent) assumption \cite{Cheon02diffie-hellmanproblems}. The security proofs presented in this paper are based on two variants of BDHE on elliptic curve subgroups, that we describe below. The security proofs also use the concept of .

\subsection{The First Complexity Assumption}
\label{subsubsec:asm_1}

Analogous to the definition in \cite{boneh2005collusion}, we define the $l$-BDHE problem in a bilinear elliptic curve subgroup $\mathbb{G}$ as follows. Given a vector of $2l+1$ elements
\vspace{-2mm}
 \begin{equation*}
 (H,P,\alpha P, {\alpha}^2P,\cdots,{\alpha}^{l}P,{\alpha}^{l+2}P\cdots,{\alpha}^{2l}P) \in \mathbb{G}_{2l+1}
 \end{equation*}
 as input, and a bilinear pairing $\hat{e'}:\mathbb{G}_1 \times \mathbb{G}_1\longrightarrow\mathbb{G}_T$ output $\hat{e'}(P,H)^{\alpha^{l+1}}\in\mathbb{G}_T$. 


Since ${\alpha}^{l+1}P$ is not an input, the bilinear pairing is of no real use in this regard. Using the shorthand $P_i = \alpha^{i}P$, an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ is said to have an advantage $\epsilon$ in solving $l$-BDHE if 
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation*}
 Pr[\mathcal{A}(H,P,P_1, P_2,\cdots,P_l,P_{l+2}\cdots,P_{2l}) =\hat{e'}(P_{l+1},H)] \geq \epsilon
\end{equation*}

where the probability is over the random choice of $H,P \in \mathbb{G}$, random choice of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and random bits used by $\mathcal{A}$. The decisional version of $l$-BDHE for elliptic curve subgroups may be analogously defined. Let $Y_{(P,\alpha,l)}=(P,P_1, P_2,\cdots,P_l,P_{l+2}\cdots,P_{2l})$. An algorithm $\mathcal{B}$ that outputs $b\in{(0,1)}$ has advantage $\epsilon$ in solving decisional $l$-BDHE in $\mathbb{G}$ if 
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation*}
 |Pr[\mathcal{B}(P,H,Y_{(P,\alpha,l)},\hat{e'}(P_{l+1},H))=0]-Pr[\mathcal{B}(G,H,Y_{(P,\alpha,l)},T))=0]| \geq \epsilon
\end{equation*}
where the probability is over the random choice of $H,P \in \mathbb{G}$, random choice of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$, random choice of $T\in \mathbb{G}_T$ and random bits used by $\mathcal{B}$. We refer to the left and right probability distributions as $L$-BDHE and $R$-BDHE respectively. Thus, it can be said that the decision $(\tau,\epsilon,l)$-BDHE assumption for elliptic curves holds in $\mathbb{G}$ if no $\tau$-time algorithm has advantage $\epsilon$  in solving the decisional $l$-BDHE problem over elliptic curve subgroup $\mathbb{G}$.

\subsection{The Second Complexity Assumption} 
\label{subsubsec:asm_2}

Next, we define the $(l,l)$-BDHE problem over a pair of equi-prime order bilinear elliptic curve subgroups $\mathbb{G}_1$ with generator $P$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$ with generator $Q$. Given a vector of $3l+2$ elements
\vspace{-2mm}
 \begin{equation*}
 (H,P,Q, \alpha P, {\alpha}^2P,\cdots,{\alpha}^{l}P,{\alpha}^{l+2}P\cdots,{\alpha}^{2l}P,\alpha Q, {\alpha}^2Q,\cdots,{\alpha}^{l}Q) 
 \end{equation*}
 as input, where $P$ and ${\alpha}^iP \in \mathbb{G}_1$ and $H,Q,\alpha^iQ \in \mathbb{G}_2$ , along with a bilinear pairing $\hat{e''}:\mathbb{G}_1 \times \mathbb{G}_2\longrightarrow\mathbb{G}_T$, output $\hat{e'}(P,H)^{\alpha^{l+1}}\in\mathbb{G}_T$. 


Since ${\alpha}^{l+1}P$ is not an input, the bilinear pairing is of no real use in this regard. Using the shorthand $P_i = \alpha^{i}P$ and $Q_i=\alpha^{i}Q$, an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ is said to have an advantage $\epsilon$ in solving $(l,l)$-BDHE if 
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation*}
 Pr[\mathcal{A}(H,P,Q,P_1, P_2,\cdots,P_l,P_{l+2}\cdots,P_{2l},Q_1,Q_2,\cdots,Q_l) =\hat{e'}(P_{l+1},H)] \geq \epsilon
\end{equation*}

where the probability is over the random choice of $P \in \mathbb{G}_1$, $H,Q \in \mathbb{G}_2$, random choice of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and random bits used by $\mathcal{A}$. We may also define the decisional $(l,l)$-BDHE problem over elliptic curve subgroup pairs as follows. Let $Y_{(P,\alpha,l)}=(P,P_1, P_2,\cdots,P_l,P_{l+2}\cdots,P_{2l})$ and $Y'_{(Q,\alpha,l)}=(Q,Q_1, Q_2,\cdots,Q_l)$. Also let $H$ be a random element in $\mathbb{G}_2$. An algorithm $\mathcal{B}$ that outputs $b\in{(0,1)}$ has advantage $\epsilon$ in solving decisional $l$-BDHE in $\mathbb{G}$ if 
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation*}
 |Pr[\mathcal{B}(P,Q,H,Y_{(P,\alpha,l)},Y'_{(Q,\alpha,l)},\hat{e'}(P_{l+1},H))=0]-Pr[\mathcal{B}(G,H,Y_{(P,\alpha,l)},Y'_{(Q,\alpha,l)},T))=0]| \geq \epsilon
\end{equation*}
where the probability is over the random choice of $P \in \mathbb{G}_1$, $H,Q \in \mathbb{G}_2$, random choice of $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$, random choice of $T\in \mathbb{G}_T$ and random bits used by $\mathcal{B}$. We refer to the left and right probability distributions as $L'$-BDHE and $R'$-BDHE respectively. Thus, it can be said that the decision $(\tau,\epsilon,l,l)$-BDHE assumption for elliptic curves holds in $(\mathbb{G}_1,\mathbb{G}_2)$ if no $\tau$-time algorithm has advantage $\epsilon$  in solving the decisional $(l,l)$-BDHE problem over elliptic curve subgroups $\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\mathbb{G}_2$. 

% We next investigate the relation between these two complexity assumptions.

\textbf{In Appendix \ref{app_sec:hardness} we prove that the decision $(\tau,\epsilon,l,l)$-BDHE assumption for elliptic curves holds in equi-prime order subgroups $(\mathbb{G}_1,\mathbb{G}_2)$ if the decision $(\tau,\epsilon,l)$-BDHE assumption for elliptic curves holds in $\mathbb{G}_1$}.
