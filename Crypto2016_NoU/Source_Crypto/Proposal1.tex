\section{KAC Using Asymmetric Multilinear Maps}
\label{sec:proposal1}

In this section, we present the first construction of identity-based KAC based on asymmetric multilinear maps. Our goal in this scheme is to ensure that the size of the public parameter is $O(\log N)$ group elements, while the ciphertext and the aggregate key comprise of $O(1)$ group elements. The construction is presented in two parts - the basic version followed by its extension for aggregate key distribution among multiple users.

\subsubsection{The Basic Idea.} Let $N=2^m-1$ for some integer $m$, and let $\mathbf{m}$ be the $m+1$ length vector consisting of all ones. We use an asymmetric multilinear map with the target group $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$. Note that if we pair two elements in the group $\mathbb{G}_{\mathbf{m}}$, we get an element in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ by the definition of asymmetric multilinear maps. Let $Y_i=g^{\alpha^i}_{\mathbf{m}}$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}_q$. Recall that $\mathbf{x}_j$ is the $j$th \emph{standard} basis vector (with $1$ at position $j$ and $0$ at each other position) and $\mathbb{G}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ is the $j$th source group with generator $g_{\mathbf{x}_i}$. Also, let $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j\leq m-1$ and $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$. We make the following claims.

\subsubsection{Claim 3.1.} Given an $i$ such that $0\leq i\leq N$, $Y_i$ can be computed from the set of parameters $(X_0,\cdots,X_m)$.
\subsubsection{Proof.} Let $i=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}i_j2^j$. We have 
\begin{equation}
 Y_i=e(X^{i_0}_0g^{1-i_0}_{\mathbf{x}_0},\cdots,X^{i_{m-1}}_{m-1}g^{1-i_{m-1}}_{\mathbf{x}_{m-1}},g_{\mathbf{x}_m})\nonumber
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Claim 3.2.} Given $i$ such that $N+2\leq i \leq 2N$, $Y_i$ can be computed from the set of parameters $(X_0,\cdots,X_m)$.
\subsubsection{Proof.} Let $i'=i-(2^m+1)=\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}i'_j2^j$. Then, we have  
\begin{equation}
 Y_i=e(X^{i'_0}_0g^{1-i'_0}_{\mathbf{x}_0},\cdots,X^{i'_{m-1}}_{m-1}g^{1-i'_{m-1}}_{\mathbf{x}_{m-1}},X_m)\nonumber
\end{equation}

\noindent We now make the following important observation.
\subsubsection{Observation 3.3.} \emph{Unless $g^{\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$ is published, it is difficult to compute the value of $Y_{N+1}$}.\\

\noindent This is the basic trick we use to embed a parameter set comprising of $O(N)$ group elements into another parameter set comprising of $O(\log N)$ group elements. We next present the construction of the basic single data-owner KAC using this framework.

\subsubsection{Assumption 3.4.} For simplicity, we assume in the forthcoming discussion that our plaintext messages are embedded as elements in the group $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$. We discuss in Appendix \ref{app_sec:relaxation} how we may modify our scheme to relax this assumption.

\subsection{Construction for the Basic KAC Framework}
\label{subsec:construction}

We first present a basic construction for the KAC scheme that focuses on generating aggregate keys. Assume that a data owner owning $N$ classes of data wishes to furnish a data user with a \emph{single} low overhead aggregate key that grants the user with decryption rights for any data class $i\in\mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is any arbitrary subset of $\{1,\cdots,N\}$. For the moment we assume that the aggregate key is received by the data owner from a trusted third party who sets up the overall system. We later show how this construction may be extended using public-key based broadcast encryption to distribute the aggregate key to multiple data users.   

Assume that \textbf{SetUp}$''(1^{\lambda},\mathbf{m})$ is the setup algorithm for an asymmetric multilinear map, where groups have prime order $q$ (where $q$ is a $\lambda$ bit prime) and $\mathbb{G}_{\mathbf{m}}$ is the target group. Our first basic identity-based KAC, for a single data owner with $N=2^m-1$ data classes, consists of the following algorithms.\\

\noindent\textbf{SetUp}$(1^{\lambda},m)$: Take as input the length $m$ of identities and the group order parameter $\lambda$. Set $\mathcal{ID}=\{0,1\}^m\backslash\{0\}^m$ as the identity space. Let $\mathbf{m}$ be the $m+1$ length vector consisting of all ones. Also, let $param''\leftarrow SetUp''(1^{\lambda'},2\mathbf{m})$ be the public parameters for a multilinear map, with $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ being the target group and $\lambda'$ is the adequate group size parameter for achieving $\lambda$ bit security (for details refer Section \ref{sec:generic_security}). Choose a random $\alpha\in \mathbb{Z}_q$. Set $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j\leq m-1$ and $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$. Output the public parameter tuple $param$ as
\begin{equation}
 param = (param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}})\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Discard $\alpha$ after $param$ has been output.\\

\noindent \textbf{KeyGen}(): Randomly pick $\gamma\in \mathbb{Z}_q$. Set the master secret key $msk=\gamma$ and the public key $PK=g^{\gamma}_{\mathbf{m}}$. Output the tuple $(msk,PK)$.\\

\noindent \textbf{Encrypt}$(param,PK,i,\mathcal{M})$: Take as input a message $\mathcal{M} \in \mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ belonging to class $i \in \mathcal{ID}$. Randomly choose $t\in\mathbb{Z}_q$. Recall that $Y_i=g^{\alpha^i}_{\mathbf{m}}$ and can be computed as per the formulation in Claim 3.1 for $1\leq i\leq N$. Output the ciphertext $\mathcal{C}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}=\left(g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}},(PK.Y_i)^{t},\mathcal{M}.g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent where $g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ is computed as $\left(e(Y_{2^m-1},Y_1)\right)^{t}$.\\

\noindent \textbf{Extract}$(param,msk,\mathcal{S})$: For the input subset of data class indices $\mathcal{S}$, the aggregate key is computed as 
\begin{equation}
 K_{\mathcal{S}} = \prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y^{msk}_{2^m-v}\nonumber
\end{equation} 
\noindent Note that this is indirectly equivalent to setting $K_{\mathcal{S}}$ to $\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}PK^{\alpha^{2^m-v}}$.\\
 
\noindent\textbf{Decrypt}$(param,\mathcal{C},i,\mathcal{S},K_{\mathcal{S}})$: If $i\notin\mathcal{S}$, output $\bot$. Otherwise, set
\begin{equation}
a_{\mathcal{S}}=\left(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S},v\neq i}Y_{2^m-v+i}\right) \text{ and } b_{\mathcal{S}}=\left(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y_{2^m-v}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
Let $\mathcal{C}=(c_0,c_1,c_2)$. Output the decrypted message as  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\hat{\mathcal{M}}&=&c_2\frac{{e}(K_{\mathcal{S}}.a_{\mathcal{S}},c_0)}{{e}(b_{\mathcal{S}},c_1)} \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Correctness.} To see that the scheme is correct, that is, $\hat{\mathcal{M}}=\mathcal{M}$, put $c_0=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}$, $c_1=(PK.Y_i)^{t}$ and $c_2=\mathcal{M}.g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$. Then we have

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
 \hat{\mathcal{M}}&=c_2\frac{{e}(K_{\mathcal{S}}.a_{\mathcal{S}},c_0)}{{e}(b_{\mathcal{S}},c_1)}\\
 &=c_2\frac{e(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y^{\gamma}_{2^m-v}.\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S},v\neq i}Y_{2^m-v+i},g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}})}{e(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y_{2^m-v},(PK.Y_i)^{t})}\\
 &=c_2\frac{e(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S},v\neq i}Y_{2^m-v+i},g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}})}{e(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y_{2^m-v},Y_i^{t})}\\
 &=\frac{\mathcal{M}.g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}}{e(Y_{2^m},g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}})}\\
 &=\mathcal{M}\nonumber
\end{split} 
\end{equation}


\subsection{Security of the Proposed KAC}
\label{subsec:security1}

We state and prove the non-adaptive CPA security of our proposed KAC scheme. We briefly state the complexity assumption that is to be used to prove the security of the proposed KAC scheme. The assumption is introduced in \cite{boneh2014low}.

\subsubsection{The Hybrid Diffie-Hellman Exponent Assumption.} Let $param''$ is generated by \textbf{SetUp}$''(1^{\lambda'},2\mathbf{m})$, where $\mathbf{m}$ is the $m+1$ length vector consisting of all ones and $\lambda'$ is the adequate group size parameter for achieving $\lambda$ bit security. Choose $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ at random (where $q$ is a $\lambda'$-bit prime), and let $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j \leq m-1$. Also, define $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$. Choose a random $t\in\mathbb{Z}_q$, and let $V=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}$. The decisional $m$-Hybrid Diffie Hellman Exponent~(HDHE) problem as defined as follows. Given the tuple $(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}},V,Z)$, distinguish if $Z$ is $g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ or a random element of $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$.

\subsubsection{Definition 3.5.} The decisional $m$-Hybrid Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$ if, for any polynomial $m$ and a probabilistic poly-time algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}$ has negligible advantage in solving the $m$-Hybrid Diffie-Hellman Exponent problem.\\

\noindent We now state and prove the following theorem.

\subsubsection{Theorem 3.6.} \textit{Let \textbf{Setup}$''$ be the setup algorithm for an asymmetric multilinear map, and let the decisional $m$-Hybrid Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$. Then our proposed basic KAC for $N$ data classes presented in Section \ref{subsec:construction} is non-adaptively CPA secure for $N=2^m-1$.}

\subsubsection{Proof.} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a poly-time adversary such that $|Adv_{\mathcal{A},N}-\frac{1}{2}| > \epsilon$ for the proposed KAC system parameterized with an identity space $\mathcal{ID}$ of size $N=2^m-1$. Here $\epsilon$ is a non-negligible positive constant. We build an algorithm $\mathcal{B}$ that has advantage at least $\epsilon$ in solving the decisional $m$-HDHE problem for \textbf{Setup}$''$. $\mathcal{B}$ takes as input a random $m$-HDHE challenge $(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}},V,Z)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $param''\leftarrow SetUp''(1^{\lambda'},2\mathbf{m})$ ($\lambda'$ is the adequate group size parameter for achieving $\lambda$ bit security)
 \item $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j \leq m-1$
 \item $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$
 \item $V=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}$ for a random $t\in\mathbb{Z}_q$ ($q$ being a $\lambda'$ bit prime)
 \item $Z$ is either $g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ or a random element of $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$
\end{itemize}
\noindent $\mathcal{B}$ then proceeds as follows.\\

% \begin{enumerate}
\noindent \textbf{Commit:} $\mathcal{B}$ runs $\mathcal{A}$ and receives the set $\mathcal{S}$ of data classes that $\mathcal{A}$ wishes to be challenged on. $\mathcal{B}$ then randomly chooses a data class $i\in\mathcal{S}$ and provides it to $\mathcal{A}$.\\
 
\noindent \textbf{SetUp}: $\mathcal{B}$ should generate the public $param$ the public key $PK$ and the aggregate key $K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}}$, and provide them to $\mathcal{A}$. They are generated as follows.
%  \vspace{-0.6mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $param$ is set as $(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}})$.
  \item $PK$ is set as ${g^u_{\mathbf{m}}}/{Y_i}$ where $u$ is chosen uniformly at random from $\mathbb{Z}_q$ and $Y_i$ is computed as mentioned in Claim 3.1. Note that this is equivalent to setting $msk=(u-\alpha^i)$.
  \item $\mathcal{B}$ then computes   
  \begin{equation}
   K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}} = \prod_{v\notin\mathcal{S}}\frac{Y^{u}_{2^m-v}}{Y_{2^m-v+i}}\nonumber
  \end{equation}
  \noindent Observe that $K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}}=\prod_{v\notin\mathcal{S}}PK^{\alpha^{2^m-v}}$, as desired. Moreover, $\mathcal{B}$ is aware that $i\notin \overline{\mathcal{S}}$ (implying $i\neq v$), and hence has all the resources to compute $K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}}$.  
\end{itemize}
 
\noindent Since the $g_{\mathbf{m}}$, $\alpha$, $u$ and $t$ values are chosen uniformly at random, \emph{all the parameters and the keys have an identical distribution to that in the actual construction}.\\
 
\noindent \textbf{Challenge}: $\mathcal{A}$ picks at random two messages $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ from the set of possible plaintext messages in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$, and provides them to $\mathcal{B}$. $\mathcal{B}$ randomly picks $b\in\{0,1\}$, and sets the challenge as $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}_0,\mathcal{M}_1)$, where 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}=(V,V^u,\mathcal{M}_b.Z) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent We claim that when $Z=g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ (i.e. the input to $\mathcal{B}$ is a valid $m$-HDHE tuple), then $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}_0,\mathcal{M}_1)$ is a valid challenge to $\mathcal{A}$ as in a real attack. To see this, observe that
\begin{eqnarray}
V=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}  &\text{ and }&  V^u= \left(g^u_{\mathbf{m}}\right)^{t}=(PK.Y_i)^{t}\nonumber \\
\mathcal{M}_b.Z&=&\mathcal{M}_b.g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Thus, by definition, $\mathcal{C}$ is a valid encryption of the message $\mathcal{M}_b$ in class $i$ and hence, $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}_0,\mathcal{M}_1)$ is a valid challenge to $\mathcal{A}$. \\
 
\noindent \textbf{Guess}: The adversary $\mathcal{A}$ outputs a guess $b'$ of $b$. If $b' = b$, $\mathcal{B}$ outputs $0$ (indicating that $Z=g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$). Otherwise, it outputs $1$ (indicating that $Z$ is a random element in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$).\\ 

\noindent We conclude that $\mathcal{B}$ has the same advantage $\epsilon$ as $\mathcal{A}$, which must therefore be negligible, as desired. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.6. Note that this proof is in the standard model and does not use random oracles. \hfill\qed 

\subsubsection{CCA Security.} The CPA secure construction of Section \ref{subsec:construction} may be efficiently combined with a signature scheme to obtain a CCA secure construction. For details, refer Appendix \ref{app_sec:CCA1}.


\subsection{An Extended KAC Construction : Broadcasting the Aggregate Keys}
\label{subsec:multiuserKAC}

We now extend the basic KAC construction to tackle the problem of aggregate key distribution in data sharing environments with multiple users. Assume that there are a maximum of $N_1$ data classes and and a maximum of $N_2$ users in the system. For simplicity, let $N_1=N_2=N$, that is, we assume the identity spaces $\mathcal{ID}_1$ and $\mathcal{ID}_2$ to be identical and denoted simply as $\mathcal{ID}$. To achieve this, one can sufficiently pad all class identity and user identity strings to have the same number of bits. The data owner grants access to a subset $\mathcal{S}$ of her data classes to a subset $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ of the data users in the system. Here, both $\mathcal{S}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ are arbitrary subset of $\{1,\cdots,N\}$, not necessarily equal. We show how the construction from Section \ref{subsec:construction} may be cleverly combined with the public-key based broadcast encryption scheme proposed in \cite{boneh2014low} to achieve a fully identity-based public key solution to this problem. 
% 
\subsubsection{Construction.} Let $N=2^m-1$ and $Setup''$ be as described before. The crux of the generalized scheme lies in the combination of the aggregate key with the broadcast encryption secret, although though they lie in different groups. Note that we do not need any additional parameters for incorporating broadcast encryption. Also note that generalization does not significantly blow up the overhead for any component of the system. In particular, the generalized scheme also consists of parameters that have size at most logarithmic in the number of data (and user) classes $N$. This allows $N$ to be exponentially large. Hence, the generalized system is fully identity-based with each data class and each user associated with a unique identity string $id\in\{0,1\}^{*}$. The class index $i$ and the user index $\hat{i}$ (where $1\leq i,\hat{i} \leq N$) are obtained by hashing the corresponding $id$ strings.\\\\
% 
\noindent\textbf{SetUp}$(1^{\lambda},m)$: Same as the basic construction in Section \ref{subsec:construction}.\\\\
% 
\noindent\textbf{OwnerKeyGen}(): Randomly pick $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3 \in \mathbb{Z}_q$. Set the master secret key $msk$ to $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ and the public key $PK=(g^{\gamma_1}_{\mathbf{m}},g^{\gamma_2}_{\mathbf{m}})$. Additionally, set the distribution secret key $dsk=\gamma_3$. Output the tuple $(msk,PK,dsk)$.\\\\
% 
\noindent\textbf{Encrypt}$(param,PK,dsk,i,\mathcal{M})$: Take as input a message $\mathcal{M} \in \mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ belonging to class $i \in \mathcal{ID}$. Randomly choose $t\in\mathbb{Z}_q$. Also, let $PK=(PK_1,PK_2)$. Output the ciphertext $\mathcal{C}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}=\left(g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}},PK^{t-dsk}_1,(PK_1.Y_i)^{t},\mathcal{M}.g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Note that the additional group element in the tuple blows up the ciphertext overhead by only a constant factor.\\

\noindent\textbf{UserKeyGen}$(param,msk,\hat{i})$: Let $msk=(msk_1,msk_2)$. Output the secret key for data user $\hat{i}$ as \begin{equation}
 d_{\hat{i}}=Y^{msk_2}_{\hat{i}}\nonumber
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Extract}$(param,msk,\mathcal{S})$: Same as the basic construction in Section \ref{subsec:construction}.\\

\noindent\textbf{Broadcast}$(param,K_{\mathcal{S}},\hat{\mathcal{S}},PK,dsk)$: Broadcasts the aggregate key $K_{\mathcal{S}}$ to all users in $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ as follows. Let $PK=(PK_1,PK_2)$. Randomly choose $\hat{t}\in\mathbb{Z}_q$ and set
\begin{equation}
 b_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}=\left(\prod_{\hat{v}\in\hat{\mathcal{S}}}Y_{2^m-\hat{v}}\right) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Output 
\begin{equation}
K_{\left(\mathcal{S},\hat{\mathcal{S}}\right)}=\left(g^{\hat{t}}_{\mathbf{m}},\left(PK_2.b^{\hat{t}}_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}\right),\mathcal{K}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent where 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K} = \left(\left(g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right).\left(e(K_{\mathcal{S}},g^{dsk}_{\mathbf{m}})\right)\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Here, $g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$ is computed as $\left(e(Y_{2^m-1},Y_1)\right)^{\hat{t}}$. Note that the actual group element corresponding to $K_{\mathcal{S}}$ is difficult to recover from $\mathcal{K}$. However, as we demonstrate next, this knowledge is not explicitly necessary for decryption.\\\\
%  
\noindent\textbf{Decrypt}$(param,\mathcal{C},K_{\left(\mathcal{S},\hat{\mathcal{S}}\right)},i,\hat{i},d_{\hat{i}},\mathcal{S},\hat{\mathcal{S}})$: If $i\notin\mathcal{S}$ or $\hat{i}\notin\hat{\mathcal{S}}$, output $\bot$. Otherwise, set
\begin{eqnarray}
 a_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}=\left(\prod_{\hat{v}\in\hat{\mathcal{S}},\hat{v}\neq \hat{i}}Y_{2^m-\hat{v}+\hat{i}}\right)&\text{ , }&
 a_{\mathcal{S}}=\left(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S},v\neq i}Y_{2^m-v+i}\right)\nonumber\\ 
 \text{and }b_{\mathcal{S}}&=&\left(\prod_{v\in\mathcal{S}}Y_{2^m-v}\right)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent Let $\mathcal{C}=(c_0,c_1,c_2,c_3)$ and $K_{\left(\mathcal{S},\hat{\mathcal{S}}\right)}=(\hat{k}_0,\hat{k}_1,\hat{k}_2)$. Output the decrypted message as  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\hat{\mathcal{M}}&=&c_3.\hat{k}_2.\left(\frac{e(b_{\mathcal{S}},c_1){e}(a_{\mathcal{S}},c_0)}{{e}(b_{\mathcal{S}},c_2)}\right).\left(\frac{e(d_{\hat{i}}.a_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}},\hat{k}_0)}{e(Y_{\hat{i}},\hat{k}_1)}\right) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Correctness of this scheme may be easily proven. We demonstrate next that this scheme is non-adaptively CPA secure in the standard model. 

% It is not difficult to show that the $m$-EHDHE assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$ if the $m$-HDHE assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$.


\subsection{Security of Extended KAC}
\label{subsec:security1_1}

We state and prove the non-adaptive CPA security of the extended multi-user KAC. We first describe the complexity assumption that is used to prove security. 

\subsubsection{The Extended Hybrid Diffie-Hellman Exponent Assumption.} Let $param''$ is generated by \textbf{SetUp}$''(1^{\lambda'},2\mathbf{m})$, where $\mathbf{m}$ is the $m+1$ length vector consisting of all ones and $\lambda'$ is the adequate group size parameter for achieving $\lambda$ bit security. Choose $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ at random (where $q$ is a $\lambda$-bit prime), and let $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j \leq m-1$. Also, define $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$. Choose random $t,\hat{t}\in\mathbb{Z}_q$, and let $V_1=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}$ and $V_2=g^{\hat{t}}_{\mathbf{m}}$. The decisional $m$-Extended Hybrid Diffie Hellman Exponent~(EHDHE) problem as defined as follows. Given the tuple
\begin{equation}
\left(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}},(V_1,V_2),(Z_1,Z_2)\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent distinguish if $(Z_1,Z_2)$ is $\left(g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}},g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right)$ or a random element in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}\times\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$.\\

\subsubsection{Definition 3.7.} The decisional $m$-EHDHE assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$ if, for any polynomial $m$ and a probabilistic poly-time algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{A}$ has negligible advantage in solving the $m$-EHDHE problem.\\

We now state and prove the following theorem:

\subsubsection{Theorem 3.8.} \textit{Let \textbf{Setup}$''$ be the setup algorithm for an asymmetric multilinear map, and let the decisional $m$-EHDHE assumption holds for {SetUp}$''$. Then the extended multi-user KAC for $N$ data classes is non-adaptively CPA secure for $N=2^m-1$.}

\subsubsection{Proof.} Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a poly-time adversary such that $|Adv_{\mathcal{A},N}-\frac{1}{2}| > \epsilon$ for the extended KAC parameterized with an identity space $\mathcal{ID}$ of size $N=2^m-1$. Here $\epsilon$ is a non-negligible positive constant. We build an algorithm $\mathcal{B}$ that has advantage at least $\epsilon$ in solving the decisional $m$-EHDHE problem for \textbf{Setup}$''$. $\mathcal{B}$ takes as input a random $m$-EHDHE challenge $(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}},(V_1,V_2),(Z_1,Z_2))$ where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $param''\leftarrow SetUp''(1^{\lambda'},2\mathbf{m})$, where $\lambda'$ is the adequate group size parameter for achieving $\lambda$ bit security.
 \item $X_j=g^{\alpha^{(2^j)}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for $0\leq j \leq m-1$
 \item $X_m=g^{\alpha^{(2^m+1)}}_{\mathbf{x}_m}$
 \item $(V_1,V_2)=\left(g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}},g^{\hat{t}}_{\mathbf{m}}\right)$ for a random $t\in\mathbb{Z}_q$ ($q$ being a $\lambda'$ bit prime)
 \item $(Z_1,Z_2)$ is either $\left(g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}},g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right)$ or a random element of $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}\times\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent $\mathcal{B}$ then proceeds as follows.\\

% \begin{enumerate}
\noindent \textbf{Commit:} $\mathcal{B}$ runs $\mathcal{A}$ and receives the set $\mathcal{S}$ of data classes and the set $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ of data users that $\mathcal{A}$ wishes to be challenged on. $\mathcal{B}$ then randomly chooses a data class $i\in\mathcal{S}$ and provides it to $\mathcal{A}$.\\
 
\noindent \textbf{SetUp}: $\mathcal{B}$ sets the following parameters and provides them to $\mathcal{A}$.
%  \vspace{-0.6mm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $param$ is set as $(param'',\{X_j\}_{j\in\{0,\cdots,m\}})\nonumber$.
  \item $PK$ is set as 
  \begin{equation}
   PK = (PK_1,PK_2) = \left(\frac{g^{\gamma_1}_{\mathbf{m}}}{Y_i},\frac{g^{\gamma_2}_{\mathbf{m}}}{\prod_{\hat{v}\in\hat{\mathcal{S}}}Y_{2^m-\hat{v}}}\right)\nonumber
  \end{equation}
  \noindent where $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ are chosen uniformly at random from $\mathbb{Z}_q$, and $Y_i$ is computed as mentioned in Claim 3.1. 
   
\end{itemize}

\noindent Note that this is equivalent to setting $msk$ as
\begin{equation}
 mak = (msk_1,msk_2) = \left(\gamma_1-\alpha^i,\gamma_2-\sum_{\hat{v}\in\hat{\mathcal{S}}}\alpha^{2^m-\hat{v}}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent $\mathcal{B}$ chooses a random $\gamma_3\in\mathbb{Z}_q$ and implicitly sets the value of the secret distribution key $dsk$ to $t-\gamma_3$ (recall that $V_1=g^{t}_{\mathbf{m}}$). We see later how this implicit definition manifests in the actual game.

Once again, since the $g_{\mathbf{m}}$, $\alpha$, $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, and $\hat{t}$ values are uniformly random, \emph{all parameters and keys have an identical distribution to that in the actual construction}.\\

\noindent\textbf{Query Phase:} $A$ is allowed to query secret keys for users $\hat{i}\notin\mathcal{S}$. $\mathcal{B}$ responds with 
\begin{equation}
 d_{\hat{i}} = \frac{Y^{\gamma_2}_{\hat{i}}}{\prod_{\hat{v}\in\hat{\mathcal{S}}}Y_{2^m-\hat{v}+\hat{i}}}\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Observe that $d_{\hat{i}}=Y^{msk_2}_{\hat{i}}$, as desired. In addition, $\mathcal{A}$ may also query for $K_{\left(\overline{\mathcal{S}},\hat{\mathcal{S}}\right)}$. This query models a collusion scenario where users in the set $\mathcal{S}$ itself may also collude to leak information about data classes not in $\mathcal{S}$. In response, $\mathcal{B}$ computes   
\begin{equation}
 K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}} = \prod_{v\notin\mathcal{S}}\frac{Y^{u}_{2^m-v}}{Y_{2^m-v+i}}\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent and sets
\begin{equation}
 \overline{\mathcal{K}} = Z_2.e(K_{\overline{\mathcal{S}}},V_1.g^{-\gamma_3}_{\mathbf{m}})\nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent Note that the implicit definition of $dsk$ is used here. Finally, $\mathcal{B}$ provides $\mathcal{A}$ with the aggregate key 
\begin{equation} 
 K_{\left(\overline{\mathcal{S}},\hat{\mathcal{S}}\right)}=\left(V_2,V^{\gamma_2}_2,\overline{\mathcal{K}}\right)\nonumber
\end{equation}

\noindent It can be easily shown that whenever $Z_2=g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$, this is a valid aggregate key that allows any user in $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ to decrypt any class $i\notin\mathcal{S}$.\\

\noindent \textbf{Challenge}: $\mathcal{A}$ picks at random two messages $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ from the set of possible plaintext messages in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$, and provides them to $\mathcal{B}$. $\mathcal{B}$ randomly picks $b\in\{0,1\}$, and sets the challenge as $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}_0,\mathcal{M}_1)$, where 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}=(V_1,PK^{\gamma_3}_1,V^{\gamma_1}_1,\mathcal{M}_b.Z_1) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent As before, whenever $Z_1=g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}$, $(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{M}_0,\mathcal{M}_1)$ is a valid challenge to $\mathcal{A}$, as in a real attack. \\

\noindent \textbf{Guess}: $\mathcal{A}$ outputs a guess $b'$ of $b$. If $b' = b$, $\mathcal{B}$ outputs $0$ (indicating that $(Z_1,Z_2)=\left(g^{t\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}},g^{\hat{t}\alpha^{(2^m)}}_{2\mathbf{m}}\right)$). Otherwise, it outputs $1$ (indicating that $(Z_1,Z_2)$ is a random element in $\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}\times\mathbb{G}_{2\mathbf{m}}$).\\ 

\noindent We conclude that $\mathcal{B}$ has the same advantage $\epsilon$ as $\mathcal{A}$, which must therefore be negligible. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.8. Note that once again, this proof is in the standard model and does not use random oracles. \hfill\qed

\subsection{Privacy of Data Owners}
\label{subsec:multiownerKAC}

In any online data sharing environment with multiple data owners, data privacy is an essential requirement. In particular, the aggregate key supplied by one data owner should not leak information about another data owner to an unauthorized user. This problem however does not arise in our construction if a new parallel instance of the KAC construction in Section \ref{subsec:multiuserKAC}  is run for each data owner. Each instance can handle $N$ data classes and can cater to $N$ data users. In order to distinguish between data classes belonging to different instances, each data class is assigned a double index $(i_1,i_2)$, where $i_1$ is the instance index, and $i_2$ is the class index specific to the instance. Each instance $i_1$ is characterized by its own master secret key $msk^{i_1}$, public key $PK^{i_1}$ and distribution key $dsk^{i_1}$. The main advantage of this approach is that all the parallel instances can share the same public $param$, which needs to be setup exactly once by the system administrator. Also note that the number of unique ordered tuples $\left(msk^{i_1},PK^{i_1},dsk^{i_1}\right)$ is $q^3$. For $q=O(N)$, a single setup can support an exponentially large number of data owners. Finally, if a data owner wishes to store more than $N$ classes of data or cater to more than $N$ data users, she may be allocated more than one instance of the KAC construction in Section \ref{subsec:multiuserKAC}.

Finally, we note that our construction is agnostic of the manner in which the data owner organizes her data. In particular, our construction is easily adaptable for hierarchical data structures, since a data owner could create an aggregate key corresponding to all the data classes rooted at any internal node, and then broadcast it to the target user group.

\subsection{Implementation Aspects} 
\label{subsec:implementation}

As stated in Section \ref{sec:prelims}, the only multilinear map candidate in the current literature that is not yet broken to the best of our knowledge is the graph-induced multilinear map construction proposed in \cite{gentry2015graph}. Although this construction lacks the nice algebraic structure afforded by some of the earlier constructions such as the GGH \cite{garg2013candidate} and CLT \cite{coron2013practical} candidates, it can be used for instantiating our proposed KAC constructions. However, we point out certain nuances that may be encountered when implementing our scheme using this candidate map construction:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The graph-induced map construction contains noise terms that could lead to erroneous operations, especially during repeated computations. This could create complications, for example, in the computation of $g^{\alpha^{2^j}}_{\mathbf{x}_j}$ for sufficiently high values of $j$, especially if one attempts to compute it via level-0 encodings of random unknown $\alpha$. However, a work-around for this is to pre-compute the level-0 encodings for the various $\alpha^{2^j}$ (where $\alpha$ is known) and then pair them with the corresponding $g_{\mathbf{x}_j}$. This means that the system administrator must herself set up the multilinear map framework instead of relying on a trusted third party. \\
 
 \item The various system parameters including the public key, the ciphertext and the aggregate key must not leak any important information, and hence need to be randomized appropriately. This implies that Kilian-style randomization parameters must be included for the group $\mathbb{G}_{\mathbb{m}}$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The exact details of how our constructions may be instantiated using graph induced multilinear map candidates is beyond the scope of this paper and is left as a future work.

% Any data class now has a double index $(i_1,i_2)$ where $i_1$ is the super-class index, while $i_2$ is the sub-class index within the superclass. Each superclass $i_1$ is characterized by its own master secret key $msk^{i_1}$, public key $PK^{i_1}$, and authentication key $U^{i_1}$. 
% 
% 
% 
% The generalized version of KAC accommodates a single data owner with $N$ data classes to be . In a practical deployment scenario, we would ideally want a system where multiple users can store their own data, and delegate multiple users with decryption rights to their own data classes. The challenge in designing such a system is to ensure that data owned by different data owners should be isolated and the aggregate key for one data owner should not reveal the data for another data owner. This concept is referred to as \emph{local aggregation}.
% 
% We tackle this issue by proposing a generalized KAC construction that uses the cryptographic security provided by the basic KAC and extends it to accommodate multiple users. The basic idea is to run several parallel instances of the basic KAC, one for each data owner. Each basic KAC can handle $N=2^m-1$ data classes. If a data owner wishes to store more than $N$ classes of data, she may request for more basic KAC instances. We refer to each of the individual owner units as \emph{data superclasses}.  Each data class now has a double index $(i_1,i_2)$ where $i_1$ is the super-class index that identifies the data owner, while $i_2$ is the sub-class index specific to the data owner. Each superclass $i_1$ is characterized by its own master secret key $msk^{i_1}$, public key $PK^{i_1}$, and authentication key $U^{i_1}$. However, the main advantage of this approach is that all the parallel instances can share the same public $param$, which needs to be setup exactly once by the system administrator. The system achieves local aggregation within each superclass in the sense that decryption rights to any subset of data classes in the same superclass can be aggregated into a single aggregate key with the same overhead as before. The ciphertext overhead corresponding to each plaintext message also remains unchanged.

% The proposed construction is highly scalable to an arbitrary number of data owners, who can register and share their data without having to alter the underlying basic KAC set-up in any way. This also implies that the basic security assumption of the system is still the $m$-HDHE assumption, and is not altered by the increase in the number of data classes.
